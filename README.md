# Finding-the-two-best-markets-to-advertise-a-product-in
In this project, I have analyzed the Free Code Camp's new coders survey data to find the two best markets to advertise an e-learning pLet's say I have an e-learning product called ABC that has courses mainly focused on Web Development, Mobile Development, and Data Science. There are also other courses in it like Mobile development, UX designing, etc., All the courses are entirely in English and each course costs $60 per month. Through data analysis, I'll try to find the best markets to advertise my product in.

For this analysis, I'll be using [FreeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) New coder Survey dataset. The dataset is available in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp-2018-new-coder-survey-of-30k-devs?). 

FreeCodeCamp is a free e-learning platform that offers courses on a variety of domains. Their survey attracted many new coders with varying interests, which is ideal for  my analysis
